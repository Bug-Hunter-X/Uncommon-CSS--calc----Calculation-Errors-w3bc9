The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there's a subtle error that can occur if you use `calc()` with multiple units without properly understanding the order of operations. For example:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
}
```

This is perfectly fine. However, consider this:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 20px - 10%);
}
}
```

It might appear that the calculation is straightforward, but some browsers might interpret this differently.  The order of operations might not be what you expect. `%` values might be interpreted before the additions or subtractions.

Another uncommon issue is with the use of `calc()` within `@media` queries, where unit conversions and unexpected rounding can lead to unexpected layout shifts.
